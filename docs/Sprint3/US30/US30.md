### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...   | Answer                   | Justification (with patterns)                                                                                                     |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1  		     | 	... interacting with the actor?              | ListPropertyView         | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.                     |
| 			  		        | 	... coordinating the US?                     | ListPropertyController   | Controller                                                                                                                        |
| 			  		        | 	... knowing the AdvertisementRepository?     | Company                  | IE: Company knows all its advertisements                                                                                          |
| 			  		        | 	                                             | AdvertisementService     | By applying High Cohesion (HC) + Low Coupling (LC) on class Company, it delegates the responsibility on AdvertisementService.     |
| 			  		        | ... creating the PropertyRepository?          | RepositoryFactory        | Factory method pattern                                                                                                            |
| Step 2  		     | 	... requesting data?				                     | RegisterStoreView        | IE: is responsible for user interactions.                                                                                         |
| Step 3  		     | 	... saving the inputted data?                | Land, Apartment or House | IE: Those classes represent each type of property, and they hold the data related to that property.                               | 
| 		             | 	... validating all data (local validation)?  | Land, Apartment or House | IE: Just like before, it holds the data related to that property so it should validate it on its own (Tell, Don't Ask principle). | 
| 			  	         | 	... validating all data (global validation)? | PropertyService          | IE: knows all existing properties.                                                                                                |
| Step 4  		     | 	... knowing all Agents?                      | AgentRepository          | IE: Knows all its agents.                                                                                                         | | 
| 		             | 	... listing all agents                       | ListPropertyView         | IE: Is responsible for user interactions.                                                                                         | | 
| Step 5  		     | 	                                             |                          |                                                                                                                                   | | 
| Step 6  		     | 	... Informing operation success?             | ListPropertyView         | IE: Is responsible for user interactions.                                                                                         | |

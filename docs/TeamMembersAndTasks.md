# 2. Task Distribution ###

Throughout the project development period, the distribution of _tasks/requirements/features_ among team members was carried out as described in the table below.

Please notice that in every sprint there are:

- some tasks that **must be** carried out by all members as a **team**, in full cooperation. Those tasks are team responsibility and each member has the duty to positively contribute to its accomplishment.
- other tasks, related to the SDP activities in the scope of a single US, must be carried out mainly by a single team member. I.e. such US tasks are the responsibility of a particular team member.

Despite this separation of responsibilities, **all team members must work in cooperation and help each other as a team**.
Furthermore, it is worth noticing that all members should have knowledge/competencies about the entire project and not just about his/her part of the project.

At last, remember that each User Story does not stand alone... it needs to be integrated with the remainders. Again, **integration** is a team responsibility.

**This table must be always up-to-date.**

| **Step 1**         | ... interacting with the client and receiving the selected date?  | **ClientView**               | **Pure Fabrication**: The **ClientView** class manages the interaction with the client, allowing the date selection input. |
| **Step 2**         | ... confirming the booking after the date selection?              | **VisitBookingController**   | **Controller**: **VisitBookingController** is responsible for processing the confirmation and ensuring the booking is registered in the system. |
| **Step 3**         | ... confirming the booking after the date selection?              | **VisitBookingController**   | **Controller**: **VisitBookingController** is responsible for processing the confirmation and ensuring the booking is registered in the system. |
| **Step 4**         | ... saving the response and updating the visit request status?    | **VisitBookingController**   | **Controller**: **VisitBookingController** processes the confirmation, ensuring the visit request status is updated. |
| **Step 5**         | ... returning the confirmation of successful operation?          | **VisitBookingController**   | **Controller**: **VisitBookingController** returns the confirmation of successful operation, completing the visit confirmation flow. |

## 4. Tests

_In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling._

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with empty values.

    class ExampleFixture : public ::testing::Test {
        TEST_F(ExampleFixture, CreateWithEmptyCode){
            EXPECT_THROW(new Example(L"",L"Example One"),std::invalid_argument);
        }
    }

_It is also recommended organizing this content by subsections._

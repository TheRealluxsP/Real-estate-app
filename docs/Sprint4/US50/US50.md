### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- Advertisement
- Company
- Agent

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- ListDealsView
- ListDealsController
- AdvertisementService
- RepositoryFactory
- PropertyService
- StoreMapper
- PropertyMapper
- AdvertisementMapper
- AdvertisementRepository

## 4. Tests

No tests were done

## 5. Implementation

A menu option on the console application was added. If the user is a Network Manager he will be able to choose that option
which will take him to the ListDealsView.

    int AuthMenuView::processMenuOption(int option) {
      int result = 0;
      BaseView *view;
      switch (option) {
        case 1:
          if(this->userToken == L"Unregistered"){
            view = new DisplayListedPropertiesView(); // Open DisplayListedPropertiesView
            view->show();
            break;
          }
          if(this->userToken == L"Client"){
            view = new ListPropertyView();
            view->show();
            break;
          }
          if(this->userToken == L"SysAdmin") {
            view = new RegisterStoreView();
            view->show();
            break;
          }
          if(this->userToken==L"NetManager"){
            view = new ListDealsView();
            view->show();
            break;
          }
        case 2:
            if(this->userToken==L"SysAdmin"){
                view = new RegisterAgentView();
                view->show();
                break;
            }
        default:
            result=-1;
            break;
      }
      return result;
    }

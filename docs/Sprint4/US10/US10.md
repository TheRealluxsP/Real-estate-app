### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- Company
- Store

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- RegisterStoreView
- RegisterStoreController
- StoreService
- StoreRepository
- RepositoryFactory

### 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

### 3.2.1. Previous Perspective (using Controllers for a Console UI)

![US10-SD](US10-SD.svg)

**Notice that:**

- According to the Repository and Service patterns, the StoreContainer was split in two classes: StoreRepository and StoreService, respectively.
- The RepositoryFactory class is the result of applying the Abstract Factory pattern to ensure that the "{XXX}Repository" classes used are all from the same family of objects (i.e., they use the same persistence mechanism).
- No DTO was used, but it could have been.

### 3.2.2 REST API Perspective (reusing the domain logic)

**To accommodate the Sprint 4 requirements.**

**This SD is in conformity with the Generic Flow in any HTTP Request defined [here](../HTTPFlow/HTTPFlow.md).**

**For brevity, sequence diagrams, can be simplified to denote just what happens on the respective Controller.**

![US10-SD-RestAPI-Simplified](US10-SD-RestAPI-Simplified.svg)

### 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

### 3.3.1 Previous Perspective (using Controllers for a Console UI)

Class diagram as resulting from the above sequence diagram and rationale:

![US10-CD](US10-CD.svg)

Adding to the previous class diagram the classes currently implementing the adopted interfaces.
Notice that the sequence diagram does not state which concrete implementation is being used since it may vary by configurations (cf. "config.ini" file).

### 3.3.2 REST API Perspective (reusing the domain logic)

**To accommodate the Sprint 4 requirements.**

Just the new classes are shown

## 4. Tests

Three relevant test scenarios are highlighted next.
Other tests were also specified.

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Store class with invalid values.

      TEST_F(StoreFixture, CreateWithEmptyCode) {
          EXPECT_THROW(new Store(L"", "Store one", "address", "12:33", "18:00"), std::invalid_argument);
      }

      TEST_F(StoreFixture, CreateWithCodeHavingFourChars) {
          EXPECT_THROW(new Store(L"C001", "Store One", "address", "12:33", "18:00"), std::invalid_argument);
      }

      TEST_F(StoreFixture, CreateWithEmptyDesignation) {
          EXPECT_THROW(new Store(L"S0001", "", "address", "12:33", "18:00"), std::invalid_argument);
      }
      
      TEST_F(StoreFixture, CreateWithEmptyAddress) {
          EXPECT_THROW(new Store(L"S0001", "Store One", "", "12:33", "18:00"), std::invalid_argument);
      }
      
      TEST_F(StoreFixture, CreateWithOpeningTimeInWrongFormat) {
          EXPECT_THROW(new Store(L"S0001", "Store One", "address", "12:3", "18:00"), std::invalid_argument);
      }
      
      TEST_F(StoreFixture, CreateWithClosingTimeInWrongFormat) {
          EXPECT_THROW(new Store(L"S0001", "Store One", "address", "12:33", "18:0"), std::invalid_argument);
      }

**Test 2:** Check that it is possible to create an instance of the Store class with valid values.

      TEST_F(StoreFixture, CreateWithValidData) {
          EXPECT_NO_THROW(new Store(L"S0001", "Store One", "address", "12:33", "18:00"));
      }

**Test 3:** Check that it is possible to create and add/save a store on the StoreMemoryRepository.

      TEST_F(StoreMemoryRepositoryFixture, AddingOneCategory) {
          EXPECT_TRUE(this->repo->isEmpty());
          shared_ptr<Store> store = make_shared<Store>(L"S0001", "Store One", "address", "12:33", "18:00");
          this->repo->save(store);
          EXPECT_FALSE(this->repo->isEmpty());
      }

## 5. Integration and Demo

A menu option on the console application was added. If the user is a System Administrator he will be able to choose that option
which will take him to the RegisterStoreView.

    int AuthMenuView::processMenuOption(int option) {
        int result = 0;
        BaseView *view;
        switch (option) {
          case 1:
            if(this->userToken == L"Client"){
                view = new ListPropertyView(this->userToken);
                view->show();
                break;
            }
            if(this->userToken == L"SysAdmin") {
                view = new RegisterStoreView(this->userToken);
                view->show();
                break;
            }
            if(this->userToken==L"NetManager"){
                view = new ListDealsView(this->userToken);
                view->show();
                break;
            }
          default:
              result=-1;
              break;
        }
        return result;
    }

## 4. Tests

Three relevant test scenarios are highlighted next.
Other tests were also specified.

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Advertisement class with invalid values (Property was tested too but for brevity only Advertisement ones are shown).

    TEST_F(AdvertisementFixture, CreateAdvertisementWithInvalidPropertyType) {
      EXPECT_THROW(new Advertisement("Casa", "Sale", 100000, property1, client, agent1), std::invalid_argument);
    }
    
    TEST_F(AdvertisementFixture, CreateAdvertisementWithInvalidTypeBusiness) {
      EXPECT_THROW(new Advertisement("Land", "Venda", 100000, property1, client, agent1), std::invalid_argument);
    }
    
    TEST_F(AdvertisementFixture, CreateAdvertisementWithInvalidPrice) {
      EXPECT_THROW(new Advertisement("Land", "Sale", -100000, property1, client, agent1), std::invalid_argument);
    }

**Test 2:** Check that it is possible to create an instance of the Advertisement class with valid values.

    TEST_F(AdvertisementFixture, CreateValidAdvertisement) {
      EXPECT_NO_THROW(new Advertisement("Land", "Sale", 100000, property1, client, agent1));
    }

**Test 3:** Check the values of an instance of the Advertisement class after creation.

    TEST_F(AdvertisementFixture, GetAdvertisementDataAfterCreation) {
      Advertisement adv("Land", "Rent", 100000, property1, client, agent1);
      EXPECT_EQ(adv.getCode(), L"1");
      EXPECT_EQ(adv.getTypeProperty(), "Land");
      EXPECT_EQ(adv.getTypeBusiness(), "Rent");
      EXPECT_EQ(adv.getPrice(), 100000);
      EXPECT_EQ(adv.getProperty(), property1);
      EXPECT_EQ(adv.getClient(), client);
      EXPECT_EQ(adv.getAgent(), agent1);
    }

## 5. Integration and Demo

A menu option on the console application was added. If the user is a Client he will be able to choose that option
which will take him to the ListPropertyView.

    int AuthMenuView::processMenuOption(int option) {
      int result = 0;
      BaseView *view;
      switch (option) {
        case 1:
          if(this->userToken == L"Unregistered"){
            view = new DisplayListedPropertiesView(); // Open DisplayListedPropertiesView
            view->show();
            break;
          }
          if(this->userToken == L"Client"){
            view = new ListPropertyView();
            view->show();
            break;
          }
          if(this->userToken == L"SysAdmin") {
            view = new RegisterStoreView();
            view->show();
            break;
          }
          if(this->userToken==L"NetManager"){
            view = new ListDealsView();
            view->show();
            break;
          }
        case 2:
            if(this->userToken==L"SysAdmin"){
                view = new RegisterAgentView();
                view->show();
                break;
            }
        default:
            result=-1;
            break;
      }
      return result;
    }
